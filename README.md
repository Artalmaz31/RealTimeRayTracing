## My improvements:

1. Added ability to create triangles. Thanks to this, it became possible to create complex 3D models. For example, I created 3D model of Tesla CyberTruck from 80 triangles.

2. Added ability to create cyclic animations for objects. Using animations you can change positions of objects, their size, color and surface reflectivity.
